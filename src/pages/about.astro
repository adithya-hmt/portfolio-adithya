      <h1>Hi, I’m Adithya S</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        19-year-old CSE student in Chennai. I build automation, AI-assisted workflows, and lean systems under the
        banner of Adithya Automations.
      </p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>
        I like building small, reliable tools: CLI-first automations, local STT/AI workflows, and Linux setups that rebuild
        quickly. Most of my time goes into writing scripts, testing prompts, and documenting the path so others can reuse the
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now I’m balancing university with a build log of experiments—anything that makes capture, study, or dev setup
        less painful.

    <section class="section">
      <h2>How I think about building</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prefer small, composable tools over big platforms.</li>
        <li>Make things reliable before making them pretty; CLI over dashboards.</li>
        <li>Keep AI features offline-friendly and auditable whenever possible.</li>
        <li>Default to text + scripts so teammates can extend without new dependencies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Tech I work with</h2>
      <div class="two-col">
        <div>
          <p><strong>Python</strong></p>
          <p>My default for scripts, cleanup jobs, and small services that glue workflows together.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p><strong>JavaScript/TypeScript</strong></p>
          <p>For frontends, CLIs, and quick tools that need to ship with minimal setup.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p><strong>Linux & CLI</strong></p>
          <p>Arch/CachyOS and WSL2; shell scripts, dotfiles, and repeatable setup tasks.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p><strong>AI workflows</strong></p>
          <p>Whisper.cpp for offline STT, light TTS, and LLM APIs when they provide leverage.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p><strong>Productivity systems</strong></p>
          <p>Notion templates plus plaintext notes; weekly reviews instead of endless dashboards.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What I want to grow into</h2>
      <p>
        I’m aiming toward systems and infra roles where reliability matters: serving small models, shipping offline-first AI
        features, and tightening evaluation loops so tools stay trustworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long term, I want to work on products that feel like assistants—fast, local when possible, and honest about what they
        can do. This portfolio is me practicing that mindset in public.
