## Problem
Context-switching between apps slowed me down. I needed one flow for tasks, journaling, and daily reviews that worked on any machine.

## Context
Built for my daily capture across WSL2 and native Linux. Designed to be shared with classmates who want simple logging without adopting a whole new app.

## Approach
- One entrypoint per action (`task`, `note`, `log`) with identical flag shapes.
- Default to plaintext first, optionally sync to Notion later.
- Human-readable output over pretty UIs so I can grep and pipe results.

## Implementation
- Python CLI with subcommands; shared parser enforces timestamps and tags on every entry.
- Bash wrappers alias the commands for muscle-memory speed.
- Optional Notion API sync script that runs only when online; plaintext remains the source of truth.
- Daily rollups are generated by a `review` command that surfaces stale tasks before adding new ones.

## What I learned
- Defaults beat flexibility: fewer flags mean I actually write the entry.
- Re-using one parser avoids subtle schema drift between commands.
- Shipping the tool forced me to document how I want to review, not just capture.
