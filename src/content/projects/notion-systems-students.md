## Problem
Notion templates often look great but feel heavy. I wanted a simple set that keeps projects and study plans aligned without micromanagement.

## Context
Designed for friends who want a planning surface that stays out of the way. It pairs with my CLI capture scripts so entries sync when needed.

## Approach
- Start with weekly cadence: intake, priorities, and a small build log per week.
- Limit properties to what I review: status, energy level, blockers, and links to code.
- Keep public-facing views clean so I can share progress without redaction.

## Implementation
- Templates for tasks, projects, and weekly reviews with short prompts.
- Build log view that surfaces just shipped items and blockers.
- Light automations that tag incoming CLI entries and file them into the right week.

## What I learned
- Template noise kills usage; fewer fields keep me honest.
- Weekly reviews catch more drift than daily journaling.
- Notion works best as a publishing layer; I still capture in plaintext first.
